# Capstone_Text_Analysis

Aim: These short snippets of code have been created to carry out text analysis through natural langauge processing on ECB statements.

Running order:
pdf_to_txt,
strip_text,
strip_last_lines,
sentiment_analysis.

Since txt files are already provided in https://github.com/tricarico672/Capstone_Text_Analysis/tree/main/txt%20statements, there is no need to run the pdf_to_txt program. 

Functioning: simply specify the directory (path to folder) where the txt files are located on your computer after the download as a variable replacing the "Your/directory" placeholder. Keep your directory specified as a string to prevent issues when running the program. Then run the sentiment_analysis snippet.
