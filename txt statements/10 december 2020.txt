PRESS RELEASE

Monetary policy decisions

10 December 2020

In view of the economic fallout from the resurgence of the pandemic, today the Governing Council recalibrated its
monetary policy instruments as follows:

First, the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the
deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00 per cent, 0.25 per cent and -0.50 per cent respectively. The Governing
Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until it has seen the inflation outlook
robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2 per cent within its projection horizon, and such convergence
has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics.

Second, the Governing Council decided to increase the envelope of the pandemic emergency purchase programme
(PEPP) by €500 billion to a total of €1,850 billion. It also extended the horizon for net purchases under the PEPP to at
least the end of March 2022. In any case, the Governing Council will conduct net purchases until it judges that the
coronavirus crisis phase is over.

The Governing Council also decided to extend the reinvestment of principal payments from maturing securities
purchased under the PEPP until at least the end of 2023. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be
managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.

Third, the Governing Council decided to further recalibrate the conditions of the third series of targeted longer-term
refinancing operations (TLTRO III). Specifically, it decided to extend the period over which considerably more favourable
terms will apply by twelve months, to June 2022. Three additional operations will also be conducted between June and
December 2021. Moreover, the Governing Council decided to raise the total amount that counterparties will be entitled to
borrow in TLTRO III operations from 50 per cent to 55 per cent of their stock of eligible loans. In order to provide an
incentive for banks to sustain the current level of bank lending, the recalibrated TLTRO III borrowing conditions will be
made available only to banks that achieve a new lending performance target.

Fourth, the Governing Council decided to extend to June 2022 the duration of the set of collateral easing measures
adopted by the Governing Council on 7 and 22 April 2020. The extension of these measures will continue to ensure that
banks can make full use of the Eurosystem’s liquidity operations, most notably the recalibrated TLTROs. The Governing
Council will reassess the collateral easing measures before June 2022, ensuring that Eurosystem counterparties’
participation in TLTRO III operations is not adversely affected.

Fifth, the Governing Council also decided to offer four additional pandemic emergency longer-term refinancing operations
(PELTROs) in 2021, which will continue to provide an effective liquidity backstop.

Sixth, net purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) will continue at a monthly pace of €20 billion. The
Governing Council continues to expect monthly net asset purchases under the APP to run for as long as necessary to
reinforce the accommodative impact of its policy rates, and to end shortly before it starts raising the key ECB interest
rates.

The Governing Council also intends to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities
purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when it starts raising the key ECB interest rates,
and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary
accommodation.

Seventh, the Eurosystem repo facility for central banks (EUREP) and all temporary swap and repo lines with non-euro
area central banks will be extended until March 2022.

Finally, the Governing Council decided to continue conducting its regular lending operations as fixed rate tender
procedures with full allotment at the prevailing conditions for as long as necessary.

Separate press releases with further details of the measures taken by the Governing Council will be published this
afternoon at 15:30 CET.

The monetary policy measures taken today will contribute to preserving favourable financing conditions over the
pandemic period, thereby supporting the flow of credit to all sectors of the economy, underpinning economic activity and
safeguarding medium-term price stability. At the same time, uncertainty remains high, including with regard to the

dynamics of the pandemic and the timing of vaccine roll-outs. We will also continue to monitor developments in the
exchange rate with regard to their possible implications for the medium-term inflation outlook. The Governing Council
therefore continues to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards
its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry.

The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting
at 14:30 CET today.
