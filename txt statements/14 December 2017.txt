Monetary policy decisions

14 December 2017

At today’s meeting the Governing Council of the ECB decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations
and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and
-0.40% respectively. The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels for an
extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases.

Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, the Governing Council confirms that from January 2018 it intends to
continue to make net asset purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP), at a monthly pace of €30 billion, until
the end of September 2018, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained
adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. If the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial
conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the
Governing Council stands ready to increase the APP in terms of size and/or duration. The Eurosystem will reinvest the
principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time after the end of its
net asset purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary. This will contribute both to favourable liquidity conditions
and to an appropriate monetary policy stance.

The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting
at 14:30 CET today.
