Monetary policy decisions

2 June 2016

At today’s meeting, which was held in Vienna, the Governing Council of the ECB decided that the interest rate on the
main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain
unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.40% respectively.

Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, on 8 June the Eurosystem will start making purchases under its
corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP). Moreover, starting on 22 June, it will conduct the first operation in its new
series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations. Further information on implementation aspects of the CSPP will be
released after the press conference on the ECB’s website.

The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting
at 14:30 CET today.
