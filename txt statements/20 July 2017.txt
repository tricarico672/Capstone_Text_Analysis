Monetary policy decisions

20 July 2017

At today’s meeting the Governing Council of the ECB decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations
and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and
-0.40% respectively. The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels for an
extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases.

Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, the Governing Council confirms that the net asset purchases, at the
current monthly pace of €60 billion, are intended to run until the end of December 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in
any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim.
The net purchases are made alongside reinvestments of the principal payments from maturing securities purchased
under the asset purchase programme. If the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become
inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stands
ready to increase the programme in terms of size and/or duration.

The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting
at 14:30 CET today.
