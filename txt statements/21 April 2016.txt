Monetary policy decisions

21 April 2016

At today’s meeting the Governing Council of the ECB decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations
and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and
-0.40% respectively.

Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, we have started to expand our monthly purchases under the asset
purchase programme to €80 billion. The focus is now on the implementation of the additional non-standard measures
decided on 10 March 2016. Further information on the implementation aspects of the corporate sector purchase
programme will be released after the press conference on the ECB’s website.

The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting
at 14:30 CET today.
