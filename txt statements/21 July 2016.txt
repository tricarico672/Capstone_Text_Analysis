Monetary policy decisions

21 July 2016

At today’s meeting the Governing Council of the ECB decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations
and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and
-0.40% respectively. The Governing Council continues to expect the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower
levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases.

Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, the Governing Council confirms that the monthly asset purchases of
€80 billion are intended to run until the end of March 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until it sees a
sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim.

The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting
at 14:30 CET today.
