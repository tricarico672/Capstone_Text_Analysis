PRESS RELEASE

Monetary policy decisions

24 January 2019

At today’s meeting the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) decided that the interest rate on the main
refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged
at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.40% respectively. The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their
present levels at least through the summer of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued
sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.

Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, the Governing Council intends to continue reinvesting, in full, the
principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme for an extended period of
time past the date when it starts raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain
favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.

The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting
at 14:30 CET today.
