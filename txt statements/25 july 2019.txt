PRESS RELEASE

Monetary policy decisions

25 July 2019

At today’s meeting the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) decided that the interest rate on the main
refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged
at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.40% respectively. The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their
present or lower levels at least through the first half of 2020, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the
continued sustained convergence of inflation to its aim over the medium term.

The Governing Council intends to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased
under the asset purchase programme for an extended period of time past the date when it starts raising the key ECB
interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree
of monetary accommodation.

The Governing Council also underlined the need for a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy for a prolonged
period of time, as inflation rates, both realised and projected, have been persistently below levels that are in line with its
aim. Accordingly, if the medium-term inflation outlook continues to fall short of its aim, the Governing Council is
determined to act, in line with its commitment to symmetry in the inflation aim. It therefore stands ready to adjust all of its
instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner.

In this context, the Governing Council has tasked the relevant Eurosystem Committees with examining options, including
ways to reinforce its forward guidance on policy rates, mitigating measures, such as the design of a tiered system for
reserve remuneration, and options for the size and composition of potential new net asset purchases.

The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting
at 14:30 CET today.
