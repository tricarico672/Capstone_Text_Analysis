PRESS RELEASE

Monetary policy decisions

25 October 2018

At today’s meeting the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) decided that the interest rate on the main
refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged
at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.40% respectively. The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their
present levels at least through the summer of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued
sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.

Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, the Governing Council will continue to make net purchases under
the asset purchase programme (APP) at the new monthly pace of €15 billion until the end of December 2018. The
Governing Council anticipates that, subject to incoming data confirming the medium-term inflation outlook, net purchases
will then end. The Governing Council intends to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under
the APP for an extended period of time after the end of the net asset purchases, and in any case for as long as
necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.

The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting
at 14:30 CET today.
