Monetary policy decisions

26 April 2018

At today’s meeting the Governing Council of the ECB decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations
and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and
-0.40% respectively. The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels for an
extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases.

Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, the Governing Council confirms that the net asset purchases, at the
current monthly pace of €30 billion, are intended to run until the end of September 2018, or beyond, if necessary, and in
any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim.
The Eurosystem will reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase
programme for an extended period of time after the end of its net asset purchases, and in any case for as long as
necessary. This will contribute both to favourable liquidity conditions and to an appropriate monetary policy stance.

The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting
at 14:30 CET today.
