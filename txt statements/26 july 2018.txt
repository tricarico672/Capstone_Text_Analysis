PRESS RELEASE

Monetary policy decisions

26 July 2018

At today’s meeting the Governing Council of the ECB decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations
and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and
-0.40% respectively. The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels at least
through the summer of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of
inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.

Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, the Governing Council will continue to make net purchases under
the asset purchase programme (APP) at the current monthly pace of €30 billion until the end of September 2018. The
Governing Council anticipates that, after September 2018, subject to incoming data confirming the Governing Council’s
medium-term inflation outlook, the monthly pace of the net asset purchases will be reduced to €15 billion until the end of
December 2018 and that net purchases will then end. The Governing Council intends to reinvest the principal payments
from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time after the end of the net asset
purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of
monetary accommodation.

The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting
at 14:30 CET today.
